## Mining (Continued)

- Based on proof of work
- Find a _nonce_ for the new block

hash(block + nonce) < difficulty target

- Everyone can easily verify the new block
- Difficulty adjusted every ~14 days
- Aimed to keep influx of coins steady (new block every ~10 minutes)

note:
- Basically that nonce is just a bunch of zeros
