## Block chain

- Public ledger recording all transactions
- Transactions are published to the whole network
- Miners solve proof-of-work to verify transactions (= block)
- Winning miner rewarded with coins


note:
- Everyone has a copy
- POW every 10 minutes
- Rewarded amount of coins halved each 4 years. Started at 25
- Block linked to previous blocks (= chain)
- Bitcoins only truly exist in the ledger as unspent amounts
