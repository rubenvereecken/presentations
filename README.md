# My Presentations

After having created
quite a few slide decks
in my time, quite a few using
reveal.js,
I decided I should keep them somewhere.
You never know when they might come in handy.
Since most of them are actually web pages,
I host them on some server.
Servers might come and go...
but slide decks should'nt necessarily.

I present then: my (rather sober) collection of presentations.
