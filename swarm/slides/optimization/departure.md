## Agreed Departure

![](resources/departure.png)

note:
- Imagine red is settled
- Also imagine red has scanned but there are no angles within the 120 degree range
- Still, you want to explore nearby because there is a goal there, so red can't just leave
- The next one that comes around is allowed to explore, but as soon as it wants to attach,
  Both red and next one leave. This allows the chain to free up more quickly
  instead of waiting for the probabilities to trigger


- Especially useful when tail is stuck in corners
