## Disbandment

![](resources/disband_soon.png)

note:
- If a tail/tail explorer notices the end of chain, disband the whole chain.
  (it propagates backward).
- This frees up a lot of robots at once because you know the chain is probably
  going to be worthless and it will otherwise take a looot of time to break up
  the chain by chance alone.
- Now the whole chain can pursue another direction
- Note: will not work well when goals are all on one line, then chains will have
  to go around. Will actually be hurtful in this scenario.
  It's particularly good in the two-pronged scenario here.
